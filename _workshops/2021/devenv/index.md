Join our interactive workshop about technologies and techniques to manage your development environment and keep it clean and tidy. The workshop takes place on **08.06.2021 from 01:00 PM to 04:00 PM** via [Zoom](https://th-koeln.zoom.us/j/89337586017?pwd=L2hBbmczaWJ6TStkUjMxTHlRc0ZhUT09) in German.

The workshop goal is to spread awareness on why a good development environment must be clean and how to keep it that way. We will take a look at good pratices used by developers all over the world. The discussed methods and ideas apply to most (if not all) types of developers independent of their field of development.

The course will be split into two major sections. One addresses **personal environments**, the second one adresses (shared) **project environments**. If there is time left at the end, we'll start an **open discussion** on clean software environments and share experiences and recommendations.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Answer the survey

In order to fit the workshop perfectly to your needs, I'd like you to answer a couple of questions in [this survey](https://ilias.th-koeln.de/ilias.php?baseClass=ilObjSurveyGUI&ref_id=1924966&cmd=infoScreen). Please note that you must be a member of the ILIAS course "Web Technologien" to access the survey.

### 2. Think about tools and techniques you already use

You might have a couple of tools or techniques handy that help you manage and maintain a clean development environment. There are a thousand ways on how to archive that goal. Therefore, we'd love to hear your approaches and ideas. Please think about that and write your thoughts down.

The following questions might help you. Just be creative and use your notes in the discussions in the workshop.
- How do I setup a new computer?
- How do I handle projects on my computer?
- What tools do I use that I can't live without anymore?
- What do I do differently than other fellow developers I know? 
- What do I do differently nowadays compared to the past?
